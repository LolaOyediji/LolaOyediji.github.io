                    I always say “a level of discomfort is required in order for me to grow”.<br/><br/>

                    I recently read The Flinch by Julien Smith. The definition of the flinch is: “to draw back or shrink, as from what is dangerous, difficult, or unpleasant; to shrink under pain; wince”. You know that feeling of initial panic or hesitation, those butterflies in your stomach and the self-doubt that talks you out of doing that thing? Well that is the flinch and Julien encourages people to do the things that make them flinch.<br/><br/>

                    I regularly try and push myself outside of my comfort zone because I believe anything is possible if you put your mind to it. I put that into practice by setting myself challenges, I view them as if they were mini experiments and whatever the outcome I can almost always guarantee that I have learned something and that is what’s important.<br/><br/>

                    The Zone of Discomfort is an interesting and challenging place. A place where you do things differently, learn and develop. It’s a place where growth happens.<br/><br/>

                    I encourage everyone to regularly explore life outside of their comfort zone. Often, we shy away from the things that do not feel good which makes sense, but by doing so we run the risk of becoming static. We fall into the same repetitive patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving. And with this automated way of living we prevent the potential for growth.<br/><br/>

                    So each month I am going to post a new challenge and I invite you take part in it with me. Stepping outside of what’s comfortable may be difficult and possibly a bit scary but nothing is wrong with being scared. Being scared just means you’re facing something that could change your life and that is a good thing.<br/><br/>

                    Remember, you’re bigger than your fears. So don’t fear the flinch. Face it.
